milky-dropwizard
================

This is another attempt for Milky Way. This approach use Dropwizard technology and based on Web Services. 
I am using this approach because it will allow me to create more modular structure for MilkyWay application.
This application contains 3 big parts:
 
	- milky-core: consist of models and data definition
	- milky-services: providing web services
	- milky-client: client consuming web service and providing user interactions.

Build on:

	1. Dropwizard 0.6.1
